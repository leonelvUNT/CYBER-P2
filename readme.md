# Project 2 Cyber Security

## got the complete set of points from the gradebot when i ran it nativly as i showed with the screenshots

## Came into issues with writing on the database with simple commands when it came into my actuall main file but not dumby scractch files and managed to resolve it working it a slightly different way starting again from base, but dont really know why it had that bug in the first place.

mainN4NL.py is the file with the program and should run normally on the command line
